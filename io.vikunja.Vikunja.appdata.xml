	<summary>The open-source, self-hostable to-do app. Organize everything, on all platforms.</summary>
	<description>
		Think of Vikunja like the notebook you have with all your things to keep track of.
		But with superpowers.
		
		Stay organized
		
		Organize all of your tasks in projects.
		Create subprojects organize everything hierarchical and keep related stuff grouped together.
		
		Collaborate with peers
		
		Vikunja lets you easily share a project with another user or a whole team!
		Assignments show who's working on what.
		
		Use it how you need it
		
		You can view your tasks in the classic list view -or in a Gantt Chart, or Table view, or Kanban Board.
		Whatever you need!
		
		Open Source
		
		Vikunja is openly licensed under the AGPLv3.
		You can contribute in multiple ways, even if you're not a developer!
		It already helps a lot when you use Vikunja and report features you'd like or bugs you find.
		And if you are a developer and know your way around Go or Vue.js, any help is appreciated.
