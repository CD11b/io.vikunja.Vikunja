	<summary>The open-source, self-hostable to-do app. Organize everything, on all platforms.</summary>
	<description>
		<p>Think of Vikunja like the notebook you have with all your things to keep track of.</p>
		<p>But with superpowers.</p>
		
		<p>‚òëÔ∏è Stay organized</p>
		
		<p>Organize all of your tasks in projects.</p>
		<p>Create subprojects organize everything hierarchical and keep related stuff grouped together.</p>
		
		<p>üë• Collaborate with peers</p>
		
		<p>Vikunja lets you easily share a project with another user or a whole team!</p>
		<p>Assignments show who's working on what.</p>
		
		<p>üß© Use it how you need it</p>
		
		<p>You can view your tasks in the classic list view -or in a Gantt Chart, or Table view, or Kanban Board.</p>
		<p>Whatever you need!</p>
		
		<p>üìñ Open Source</p>
		
		<p>Vikunja is openly licensed under the AGPLv3.</p>
		<p>You can contribute in multiple ways, even if you're not a developer!</p>
		<p>It already helps a lot when you use Vikunja and report features you'd like or bugs you find.</p>
		<p>And if you are a developer and know your way around Go or Vue.js, any help is appreciated.</p>
